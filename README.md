# homebridge-ewelink
Homebridge plugin to control Sonoff relays with OEM firmware

## Shortcomings

The plugin uses the same credentials as the eWeLink app. In order to obtain the authenticationToken, you'll need to use Charles to inspect the traffic and grab the value from the Authorization header. To do: document this.

Also, the code is of suboptimal quality. It was a quick-and-dirty plugin; feel free to contribute & improve.

## Sample config.json

```
{
    "bridge": {
        "name": "Homebridge",
        "username": "XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX",
        "port": 51826,
        "pin": "123-45-678"
    },
    
    "description": "This is an example configuration file with one fake accessory and one fake platform. You can use this as a template for creating your own configuration file containing devices you actually own.",

    "accessories": [
    ],

    "platforms": [
        {
        "platform" : "eWeLink",
        "name" : "eWeLink",
        "authenticationToken" : "obtain-with-Charles",
        "apiHost" : "us-api.coolkit.cc:8080",
        "webSocketApi" : "us-long.coolkit.cc"
        }
    ]
}
```

The plugin will also listen for announcements via a persistent web socket. This allows you to control the device from the likes of Google Home & have Homebridge be kept up-to-date
